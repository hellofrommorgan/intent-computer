# methods

How the research gets done. This topic map collects claims about methodology: which approaches work for which problems, what trade-offs different techniques carry, and how workflows evolve as understanding deepens.

## Core Ideas

Add methodology claims here as you discover patterns in how research proceeds. Compare approaches, note what works, document what fails.

## Tensions

Methodological conflicts belong here: when two valid approaches contradict, or when a technique works in one context but fails in another.

## Explorations Needed

- Document the initial research workflow and its assumptions
- Identify which methodology comparisons matter most for your domain
