# index

Welcome to your research vault. This hub links to all active research domains. Start here when orienting to what exists, then navigate to the relevant topic map.

## Core Ideas

Replace this section with links to your domain topic maps as they emerge. Each topic map organizes claims, evidence, and open questions for a specific research area.

## Explorations Needed

- Define your primary research domain and create its first topic map
- Identify 3-5 seed sources to process through the pipeline
