# open questions

A living register of what you do not yet know. Questions surface during reduction, reflection, and reweaving. They dissolve when claims answer them or when the question itself turns out to be malformed.

## Core Ideas

Add open questions here as they emerge from processing. Each question should be specific enough that you would recognize an answer if you found one.

## Tensions

Questions that pull in opposite directions or where the framing itself is contested belong here.

## Explorations Needed

- Review initial sources for questions that resist easy answers
- Identify which questions are most likely to yield productive research
