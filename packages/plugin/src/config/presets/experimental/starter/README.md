# Experimental Preset Starter

This preset uses conversation-driven derivation. No starter MOCs are pre-defined.

During initialization, the onboarding conversation guides the user through design decisions for each dimension, surfacing relevant thinking notes to inform choices. The resulting configuration determines which starter MOCs to create, what vocabulary to use, and which blocks to activate.

The starter directory is intentionally empty. MOCs are generated based on the conversation outcome, not pre-built templates.
