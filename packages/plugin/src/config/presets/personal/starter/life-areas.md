# areas of focus

The parts of your life that get your attention. Not everything at once, just the areas where you are actively growing, struggling, or paying attention. This map helps you see the whole picture so individual reflections do not feel disconnected.

## Core Ideas

Add the life areas that matter to you. Common starting points include relationships, health, work, creativity, and inner life, but yours might look different.

## Tensions

When one area crowds out others, or when you notice avoidance, capture that here.

## Explorations Needed

- Which areas are getting too little attention?
- Where do you feel most alive, and what does that tell you?
