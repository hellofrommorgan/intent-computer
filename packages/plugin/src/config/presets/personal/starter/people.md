# people

The people in your life. Not a contacts list but a reflection surface: what matters to each person, what you have learned about them, how the relationship is growing or stalling. The point is to be more thoughtful, not more organized.

## Core Ideas

Add the people who matter most. For each one, capture not just facts but observations: what lights them up, what stresses them, what you wish you understood better about them.

## Tensions

When relationships pull against each other, or when being present for one person means being absent for another, capture that honestly here.

## Explorations Needed

- Who are you taking for granted?
- Which relationships would benefit from more intentional attention?
