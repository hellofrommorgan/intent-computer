# my reflections

This is your personal space. A place to think about who you are, where you are going, and what you are learning along the way. Start here to see what life areas you are tracking, then navigate to whichever feels most relevant right now.

## Core Ideas

Add links to your life area maps as they take shape. Each one organizes reflections, goals, and patterns for a part of your life that matters to you.

## Explorations Needed

- What are the 3-5 life areas that matter most to you right now?
- What patterns do you notice but rarely examine?
