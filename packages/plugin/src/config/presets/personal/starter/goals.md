# current goals

What you are reaching for right now. Goals change, and that is fine. This is not a commitment device but a reflection surface. The point is to notice what you want, check whether it still resonates, and connect it to the rest of your life.

## Core Ideas

Add your goals here as reflections, not tasks. Each goal is worth a note that captures not just what you want but why you want it and what getting there would feel like.

## Tensions

Sometimes goals pull against each other. That tension is worth noticing, not resolving immediately.

## Explorations Needed

- What would you work on if nobody was watching?
- Which goals are truly yours versus inherited expectations?
