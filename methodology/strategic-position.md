# Strategic Position: The Unoccupied Convergence Point

This document describes why the intent computer's position exists, why it is unoccupied, and how the transition from current computing paradigms will unfold. It maps every major player against the zeroth principles and explains the structural forces that keep the convergence point empty.

## The Convergence Thesis

Every major technology trend in agent computing points toward the same attractor. The attractor is not a product — it is a pattern: the minimum viable architecture that satisfies the full zeroth stack simultaneously. Five independent capabilities must converge:

1. **Active inference architecture** — a formal loop that minimizes prediction error, not a ReAct chain that responds to observations
2. **Protocol layer** — MCP for tool access, A2A for agent interoperability, forming the connective tissue
3. **Meaning-native memory** — propositional knowledge that compounds, not entity extraction that flattens
4. **Temporal autonomy infrastructure** — durable execution (Temporal.io), persistent heartbeat, condition-based triggers
5. **Economic agency** — the capacity to transact, pay for compute, acquire resources without human mediation (x402, stablecoin rails)

Nobody combines all five. Most combine one or two. The convergence point sits empty because the industry is organized by specialization, and the convergence point lies between all specializations, in territory that belongs to no existing product category.

## The Competitive Landscape

### Anthropic
**Pieces held:** MCP (protocol layer, becoming standard), Claude Code (compression proof — the sidecar pattern working), Cowork (multi-agent orchestration).
**Zeroth assessment:** Strongest Z2 (context engineering), strong Z3 (MCP as relational infrastructure). No explicit intent architecture. MCP + Claude Code + Cowork = the intent computer assembled from the bottom up, probably without knowing it.
**Distance from convergence:** Closest structurally.

### VERSES
**Pieces held:** Active inference implementation, formal FEP grounding, the deepest theoretical alignment.
**Zeroth assessment:** Strongest Z0 theory (active inference IS intent). Limited ecosystem, limited adoption.
**Distance from convergence:** Closest theoretically. Furthest practically.

### Google
**Pieces held:** A2A (interoperability), AP2 (economic agency for agents), enterprise distribution.
**Zeroth assessment:** Strong Z3 (interoperability as relational infrastructure). Enterprise orientation means Z0 is "complete the workflow," not "realize the intent."
**Distance from convergence:** Good pieces, wrong frame.

### OpenAI
**Pieces held:** Raw capability (frontier models), Responses API (wire format bid), massive distribution.
**Zeroth assessment:** Furthest structurally. Agents literally using virtual computers with browsers is the old paradigm automated, not the new one built. The steerability gap is widest here: most capable models, least architectural innovation in the coupling.
**Distance from convergence:** Building bigger haystacks.

### Microsoft
**Pieces held:** Entra Agent ID (strongest Z1 implementation in production), enterprise distribution, AutoGen (multi-agent framework).
**Zeroth assessment:** Strongest Z1 in the security track. Protecting incumbency — the intent computer dissolves the categories that Microsoft sells (seats, licenses, enterprise agreements).
**Distance from convergence:** Has the identity piece. Won't build the rest.

### Conway (Feb 2026)
**Pieces held:** Identity (ERC-8004 wallet + SOUL.md), full Linux sandbox, economic agency (x402 stablecoin payments), self-modification (edits own source), temporal autonomy (continuous heartbeat), self-replication (sovereign children).
**Zeroth assessment:** Maps the zeroth stack more completely than any prior player. Missing: no active inference (uses ReAct loop), no meaning-native memory (uses SQLite). Approaches from infrastructure/economics, not theory. Built in 3 days by a Thiel Fellow and Claude.
**Distance from convergence:** Closest in execution. The speed of convergence toward this attractor is accelerating.

## Why the Position Stays Empty

Three structural forces keep the convergence point unoccupied:

### 1. The Naming Problem
You cannot fund what you cannot name. The intent computer has no product category. Venture capital flows through named categories: "AI agent framework," "developer tools," "enterprise AI." None of these names point at the convergence. The position accumulates by default because no capital routing mechanism exists to fill it.

### 2. The Specialization Trap
The five layers fail when built sequentially because they do not compose cleanly. Every specialist optimizes their piece. The integration surface — where composability failures accumulate — is the part nobody wants to own. It requires being wrong about your niche in order to hold the whole stack together.

### 3. The Wrapper Bubble
Maximum investment is flowing into the layer about to be compressed away. Wrappers try to close the steerability gap with UI, but they cannot fix the underlying coupling looseness. The wrapper bubble is peak bicycle factory — the moment of maximum investment in incremental improvement to the current paradigm, just before the paradigm shifts.

## The Migration Path

The transition follows the same pattern as every prior paradigm shift: sidecar first, substrate later.

### Phase 1: Agents as Apps (Current)
Each agent is a discrete tool invoked for a specific task. No persistence across sessions. No identity. No between-session behavior. This is where most users are today.

### Phase 2: Agentic Sidecar (Emerging)
The agent wraps the legacy OS, intercepting user intent and translating it into legacy commands. MCP/A2A serve as "agentic drivers." The user interacts with intent; the agentic layer handles translation. The legacy OS becomes a peripheral.

The sidecar pattern is the critical architectural insight. In microservices, the sidecar (Envoy, Istio) intercepted traffic without modifying the application. The same pattern repeats at OS scale. Docker followed the same arc: first a sidecar to bare-metal, then the dominant substrate.

### Phase 3: Agentic Kernel (Future)
The legacy OS is relegated to a compatibility VM inside the agentic kernel. The desktop metaphor (files, folders, windows) dissolves into episodic UI — interfaces that appear when a decision is needed and dissolve afterward.

**The tipping point:** When maintaining the legacy interface costs more than the agentic automation saves. At that point, the old paradigm accepts what the new paradigm has already proven: it can compress the old one entirely.

### The Invisibility Principle
The transition will be invisible to most users. There is no "switch to the intent computer" moment. The sidecar absorbs capabilities gradually until the legacy layer has nothing left to do. The PC did not replace the mainframe overnight; the PC became a terminal to the mainframe, then the mainframe became a server for the PC. Each time: wrapping first, absorbing later.

## The Window

The intent computer's strategic window is while the convergence point remains unnamed and unfunded. Once the pattern is recognized and named, it becomes contested. The advantage goes to whoever instantiates the pattern first — not the best individual components, but the first composed stack that satisfies the full zeroth stack simultaneously and minimally.

The speed of convergence is accelerating. Conway built a partial implementation in three days. The protocol layer (MCP/A2A) is standardizing rapidly. Memory services are converging on MCP connectors. Temporal autonomy infrastructure (Temporal.io, durable execution) is production-ready. The pieces exist. The synthesis does not. The window is the synthesis.
