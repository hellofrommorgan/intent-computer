    <p>This runs on every session start and whenever your agent detects a shift in what you're working on. It's how your agent stays oriented instead of just reacting to your last message.</p>

    <h2>Perception</h2>
    <p>The perception layer reads the state of your knowledge and surfaces <strong>signals</strong> (observations) and <strong>gaps</strong> (problems). Is your inbox piling up? Are there notes with no connections? Have you been ignoring a commitment for two weeks?</p>
    <p>Perception is threshold-gated &mdash; small vaults don't trigger noise, but real issues at scale get caught. Three unprocessed items in the inbox triggers attention. Five disconnected notes triggers connection work.</p>

    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>Your agent maintains a sense of who it is and what you care about, drawn from three sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity</strong> &mdash; the agent's voice, role, and relationship to you</li>
      <li><strong>Goals</strong> &mdash; your active commitments with priority and timeframe</li>
      <li><strong>Working memory</strong> &mdash; what happened recently, updated every session</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This layer also detects <strong>drift</strong> &mdash; when what you're actually doing diverges from what you said matters. It won't stop you, but it will notice.</p>

    <h2>Commitment</h2>
    <p>This is where prioritization happens. The loop takes the problems perception found and the goals identity loaded, and asks: <strong>which of these actually matter?</strong></p>
    <p>Some problems are urgent &mdash; broken links, overflowing inbox. Some can wait &mdash; a few disconnected notes aren't an emergency. The commitment layer sorts them so your agent focuses on what's important, not just what's recent.</p>

    <h2>Memory</h2>
    <p>The memory layer loads the parts of your <a href="/context">context graph</a> that are relevant to your current commitments. Not the whole graph &mdash; just the subset that matters right now. This is how session 50 knows everything session 1 learned, without drowning in irrelevant context.</p>

    <h2>Execution</h2>
    <p>The execution layer proposes actions and checks whether it has permission to take them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Autonomous</strong> &mdash; just does it (e.g., auto-committing after a write)</li>
      <li><strong>Delegated</strong> &mdash; does it with your approval</li>
      <li><strong>Advisory</strong> &mdash; suggests but doesn't act</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> &mdash; won't even suggest it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You control exactly how much autonomy your agent has. Every action, every level &mdash; configured in a single policy file.</p>

    <h2>The heartbeat</h2>
    <p>Between sessions, a background scheduler runs every 15 minutes. It checks your commitments, picks up queued tasks that align with your goals, detects stale work, and writes summaries. Your agent keeps tending the garden even when you're not looking.</p>
    <p>The heartbeat doesn't do full reasoning &mdash; it handles maintenance and surfaces what needs attention. Deep thinking stays in-session where you can see it.</p>

    <h2>The architecture</h2>

    <div class="code-block"><span class="kw">interface</span> <span class="fn">IntentComputerLayers</span> {
  <span class="fn">perception</span>:  <span class="fn">PerceptionPort</span>;    <span class="cm">// what's happening?</span>
  <span class="fn">identity</span>:    <span class="fn">IdentityPort</span>;      <span class="cm">// who am I?</span>
  <span class="fn">commitment</span>:  <span class="fn">CommitmentPort</span>;    <span class="cm">// what matters?</span>
  <span class="fn">memory</span>:      <span class="fn">MemoryPort</span>;        <span class="cm">// what do I know?</span>
  <span class="fn">execution</span>:   <span class="fn">ExecutionPort</span>;     <span class="cm">// what should I do?</span>
}</div>

    <p>Five layers. Each one is a clean interface with a swappable implementation. Today they read your local filesystem. Tomorrow they could read a cloud API. The loop stays the same.</p>
