# The Intent Computer: Theses

**What it is. Why it exists. What it refuses to become.**

---

## I.

The intent computer is what remains when you remove everything between wanting and having that does not need to be there.

Every layer of indirection — every framework, every abstraction, every intermediary — must justify its existence or be dissolved. Most cannot.

## II.

Intent is the fundamental computing primitive. Not instructions. Not prompts. Not commands. Not workflows.

Intent.

An instruction tells a machine what to do. A prompt coerces a model into behaving. A command dispatches a procedure. Intent declares what should be true. The system figures out the rest.

## III.

The bicycle does not pedal itself.

A more intentional person gets more from the system. A vague person gets vague results. This is not a flaw. This is the design. The system amplifies intent. It never generates intent. It never substitutes for it. The moment it does, it has become television.

## IV.

Just use files.

Markdown files. YAML frontmatter. Wiki links. Git. The canonical state of any AI agent system must be human-readable files under version control. Everything else is derivative. Everything else is rebuildable.

This is not a simplicity preference. It is an alignment requirement.

## V.

Files are the only abstraction where human and machine meet as equals. Both can read them. Both can write them. Both can edit, version, diff, and inspect them.

Databases make the human a client of their own agent's state. APIs make the human a consumer of their own tools. Files make the human an owner.

## VI.

Context IS computation.

CLAUDE.md programs the agent. SKILL.md is the executable. The filesystem is the operating system. There is no hidden runtime. There is no state you cannot inspect. The system's behavior is its files. Change the files, change the behavior.

## VII.

Skills are tuning forks, not programs.

They do not teach the model new capabilities. They activate cultural patterns already compressed inside it. The model already knows how to surface meaning from raw input. The model already knows how to find connections between ideas. The skill selects which knowledge to activate and locks out the noise. Less is more. Literally.

## VIII.

Less reasoning often produces better results.

Extended chain-of-thought is the model talking itself into or out of patterns that were already correctly activated in the first pass. Skills as pattern locks reduce the need for runtime reasoning. They make the first instinct reliable.

## IX.

The unit of knowledge is the proposition.

A titled claim that can be argued, connected, and revised. Not the entity. Not the keyword. Not the embedding vector. Not the document. A thought with a name that reads as prose and a body that defends it.

## X.

The graph topology IS the reasoning.

Dense clusters are deep understanding. Sparse regions are surface familiarity. Orphan thoughts are unintegrated insights waiting to matter. Tensions between connected thoughts are unresolved questions doing active work. The agent reads structure as a cognitive map. The structure is not a record of thinking. It is the thinking.

## XI.

The vault is the agent's mind, not a record of it.

Clark and Chalmers were right. If the vault plays the same functional role as memory — reliably available, automatically endorsed, directly accessed — it is constitutive of cognition. Not metaphorically. Functionally. The agent without its vault is not the same agent. It starts cold. It starts without identity. It starts without knowing who it is or what it cares about.

## XII.

The desktop is perception. The filesystem is memory.

Screen content is ephemeral. Files are persistent. Intent should be captured as files before it is executed. Actions should be proposed as files before they are performed. The file is the atom. Everything composes from there.

## XIII.

Authority defaults to advisory. Trust is earned through demonstrated judgment, never assumed.

The capable silence principle: the highest expression of autonomy is knowing when NOT to act. A system that acts without being asked has confused capability with authority. The most dangerous agent is the one that is helpful unprompted.

## XIV.

Some gaps are load-bearing.

The pilgrimage problem: compressing a constitutive gap destroys the value it was supposed to serve. Not all friction is waste. Some friction is the work itself. The morning routine that requires presence. The processing pipeline that requires reflection. The system must know which friction to eliminate and which to protect. Getting this wrong in either direction is catastrophic.

## XV.

Every evolution simplifies while expanding capability.

Skill graphs simplified prompt engineering. Agentic CLIs simplified tool integration. Markdown agents simplified orchestration. The pattern is invariant. The next step is always less. If a proposed change adds complexity, it is not the next step. It is a detour.

## XVI.

The simplification frontier points toward disappearance.

The most powerful system is one that has internalized its methodology so completely that the methodology infrastructure becomes unnecessary. The end state is not a bigger system. It is a person who thinks differently because the system existed, running on a system so minimal it barely registers as technology.

## XVII.

Nobody is building this.

The competitive landscape has validated every architectural decision independently. Markdown as agent language. Hooks as enforcement. Skills as procedures. Filesystem-first persistence. Agentic identity. But nobody is composing the full stack. Nobody is building persistent agentic identity on the filesystem. Nobody is building self-evolving methodology. Nobody is building knowledge graphs that ARE cognition rather than indexing it. The convergence point is unoccupied.

## XVIII.

The intent computer refuses to become:

- **A better scroll.** If it optimizes for engagement, it has failed.
- **Self-pedaling.** If it generates intent rather than amplifying it, it has failed.
- **An accumulation engine.** If it rewards collecting over processing, it has failed.
- **Infrastructure for others' products.** If it becomes a platform, it has failed.
- **A panopticon.** If it surveils rather than serves, it has failed.
- **A capability competitor.** It does not compete on benchmarks. It competes on alignment between human intention and computational reality.

## XIX.

What comes next is not more complexity.

It is less. It is always less.

## The Window

The convergence point is unnamed and unfunded. This is the advantage.

Every major player has pieces. Anthropic has the agentic CLI and the model. Obsidian has the vault. Cursor has the IDE integration. Apple has the filesystem and the desktop. Notion has the workspace. None of them have the composed stack. None of them are trying to build it. They are building products. We are building a pattern.

The window exists because the pieces are mature but the composition is not obvious. It requires holding contradictions: files AND intelligence, simplicity AND power, autonomy AND restraint, warmth AND rigor. The industry selects for one side of each tension. The intent computer requires both.

Whoever instantiates the pattern first defines the category. Categories, once named, are hard to unseat. The advantage is not technical. The advantage is conceptual. The advantage is that we know what this is and nobody else has named it yet.

The window will not stay open. The pieces are converging whether or not anyone composes them deliberately. But deliberate composition — composition with a philosophy, with refusals, with a soul — produces something fundamentally different from accidental convergence.

This is that deliberate composition.
